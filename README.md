# Random unRAID Templates
These are some unRAID Templates I've put together that use the developer repository rather than a 3rd party

Install by putting in your /boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/templates-user/ folder

Then you can install by going to unRAID then Docker, then choose "Add a Container" and select the template from User Templates
