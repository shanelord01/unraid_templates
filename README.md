# Random unRAID Templates
These are some unRAID Templates I've put together that do one or more of the following:

1. Use the developer repository rather than a 3rd party
2. Use similar base folders to simplify use (across the *arr packages)
3. Enable Timezone, NVIDIA and /dev/dri capabilities

Install by putting the xml file from the /user_templates/ section here into your unRAID /boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/templates-user/ folder

Then you can install by going to unRAID then Docker, then choose "Add a Container" and select the template from User Templates
